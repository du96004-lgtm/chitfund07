Authorization Independence is achieved through path-based ownership for user-related data and denormalization where needed. For example, `chitGroups` includes the `adminId` to ensure that access control can be enforced without needing to `get()` the user's profile.  Collections are segregated based on their security posture (e.g., user profiles are separated from chit groups).  The structure also facilitates secure `list` operations by ensuring that collections contain documents with homogeneous security requirements. Roles are managed implicitly through document ownership (e.g., a user is an admin of a chit group if they created it, as denoted by the adminId). User profile, KYC, and bank details are stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, providing clear ownership. Chit groups are stored in a separate collection, with each chit group document containing the `adminId` to denote the group administrator. Payment information is stored in a `payments` subcollection under each user, linking payment activity to the user who made the payment."
